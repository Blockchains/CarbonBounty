# CarbonBounty
Aiming for the Carbon FootPrint Social Impact Prize of 10k from Blockchain for Social Impact Hackathon

We will be creating a carbon tracking system as well as a borrowing/lending system similar to Insta-D-App {and partnering with them} for savings/lending and utilization of the utility of the tokenized carbon credits to give them a proper marketplace to be used as proper currency instead of a conceptual object with no real demand as they are now.

We will increase the useability of carbon credits to the level of NFT assets making them exchangeable and saleable so the marketplace can be linked into the cryptocurrency marketplace bringing in untold wealth of carbon credits.

A charity has partnered with us for this venture that will provide the carbon credits required to collatoralize the tokenized carbon credit currencies.
