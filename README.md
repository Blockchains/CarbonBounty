# CarbonBounty
Aiming for the Carbon FootPrint Social Impact Prize of 10k from Blockchain for Social Impact Hackathon

We will be creating a carbon tracking system as well as a borrowing/lending system similar to Insta-D-App {and partnering with them} for savings/lending and utilization of the utility of the tokenized carbon credits to give them a proper marketplace to be used as proper currency instead of a conceptual object with no real demand as they are now.

We will increase the useability of carbon credits to the level of NFT assets making them exchangeable and saleable so the marketplace can be linked into the cryptocurrency marketplace bringing in untold wealth of carbon credits.

A charity has partnered with us for this venture that will provide the carbon credits required to collatoralize the tokenized carbon credit currencies.


UPDATE 1:

Update for 3/26/2020:

We have now 4 mentors and 1 coder interested in the 2 projects.

{The other is: https://github.com/cleancoindev/CityShieldBounty}

The coder who has joined is in Berlin and codes a Offset smartcontract for blockchain transactions!

This will give us the ability for parnters/owners of our tokens/investors to switch on a switch to pay offsets and 
Burn Carbon Credit Fiat to offset their GHG/Carbon gas cost to offset their emissions via burned tokenized carbon credits worth 
100 USDC/ton globally.

My current plan of approach is metamask beta dev extension.

We'll make an extension to activate carbon Offsetting mode with an Offsetting switch on metamask.
