UPDATE 5 - 4-7-2020:

I have yielded my stake in this hackathon to Raphael of co2ken.

It is my wish he wins the Carbon Bounty.  May the judges wisely choose him as the winner and make this honorable withdrawl worth the loss of the possible 10k bounty.

Raphael has stated interest in working with me on further projects.  Thank you, staff, for introducing us.  His project is amazing.

May he and his team win! 




===============================================================

Update 4: This repo is a temporary work place holder until the Mentors and Staff work with me and Extend the deadline.

I will continue work on this, I submitted work to comply to the deadlines.  All deliverables will be delivered by the 8th of APR if possible but if no extension is granted this project will remain mostly Thought-ware.  I have asked for a 2 week extension for everyone due to illness slowing down my italian and other members of the team which is global.

Now people from Germany, Canada, Brazil and Italy are involved.  This is getting interesting...let's not abort it but give it a chance to continue so all software is completed and marketing aspects/sites made.

There are software I can move to the repo if need be but there is no need to do so yet if the CoVid19 extension is not added by the staff....so I submitted my work to comply to the deadline of submission.

This does not mean this project is done at all, it has indeed just began and the mentors are helping this coming week to prepare it for judgement etc.  Thanks for reading the updates!

# CarbonBounty
Aiming for the Carbon FootPrint Social Impact Prize of 10k from Blockchain for Social Impact Hackathon

We will be creating a carbon tracking system as well as a borrowing/lending system similar to Insta-D-App {and partnering with them} for savings/lending and utilization of the utility of the tokenized carbon credits to give them a proper marketplace to be used as proper currency instead of a conceptual object with no real demand as they are now.

We will increase the useability of carbon credits to the level of NFT assets making them exchangeable and saleable so the marketplace can be linked into the cryptocurrency marketplace bringing in untold wealth of carbon credits.

A charity has partnered with us for this venture that will provide the carbon credits required to collatoralize the tokenized carbon credit currencies.


UPDATE 1:

Update for 3/26/2020:

We have now 4 mentors and 1 coder interested in the 2 projects.

{The other is: https://github.com/cleancoindev/CityShieldBounty}

The coder who has joined is in Berlin and codes a Offset smartcontract for blockchain transactions!

This will give us the ability for parnters/owners of our tokens/investors to switch on a switch to pay offsets and 
Burn Carbon Credit Fiat to offset their GHG/Carbon gas cost to offset their emissions via burned tokenized carbon credits worth 
100 USDC/ton globally.

My current plan of approach is metamask beta dev extension.

We'll make an extension to activate carbon Offsetting mode with an Offsetting switch on metamask.
